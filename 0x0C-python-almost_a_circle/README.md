# **Almost a circle**

Project done during  **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. 

In this project, I encapsulated skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the unittest module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:

**.** Import

**.** Exceptions

**.** Private attributes

**.** Getter/setter

**.** Class/static methods

**.** File I/O

**.** Inheritance

**.** JSON and CSV serialization/deserialization

**.** args/kwargs

**.** Unittesting
